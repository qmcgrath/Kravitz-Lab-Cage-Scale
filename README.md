# Kravitz-Lab-Cage-Scale
The use of food and water restriction, drugs, surgery, and disease models in live mouse studies require continuous monitoring of body weight to surveill mouse health and determine experiment endpoints. Traditional manual weighing induces stress in mice and disrupts circadian rhythms. This small mouse scale fulfills the need for a low cost, open source automatic scale that can fit in a tradition colony rack mouse cage. 
It has hourly resolution and a typical accuracy of X-X%.
