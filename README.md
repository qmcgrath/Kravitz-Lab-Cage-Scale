# Kravitz-Lab-Cage-Scale
  The use of food and water restriction, drugs, surgery, and disease models in live mouse studies require continuous monitoring of body weight to surveill mouse health and determine experiment endpoints. Resolution of weight fluctuation over time can offer researchers a more complete picture of mouse health. Traditional manual weighing induces stress in mice and disrupts circadian rhythms.Existing commercial and open source autonomous mouse weight systems are available. However, commercial systems are not cost effective and an open source system does not exist that can be used in colonial housing cages. 
  This accurate, non-invasive recording of mouse weight allows for increased volume of body weight data while decreasing animal stress and human interaction. The developed scale can be constructed for $X and operates for ~3.5 days on one charge. It has a small footprint of XxXxX and can be used in singley housed mice in traditional vivarium cages without modification. An Hx711 and proximity sensor work in tandem to determine mouse weight readings. The scale is operates on open source arduino code and data is anlysised with provided python code. 

  Experiments showed that mice interacted with the scale about 75% of hours in the cage with an average of X interactions per hour. This allowed for hourly interpolation of mouse weight. We demonstrated accurate estimation of mouse weight to about X% error. Accuracy was determined via comparision of maunaul weighing and reported weights for the same hour. X instances were used. It was demonstrated that this scale has potential appications in circadian rhythm monitoring, energy expendature evaluation, and with group housed mice.  

  Assemebly, hardware and software overviews, quick start instructions, and code documentation are available in the wiki. 
The Jupyter notebooks used for data anlysis are provided. In these notebooks you will find code to plot . In addition, you will find the analysis code used to determine the varying accuracy . This code also demonstartes the various data filtering technqiues explored.

## Results
X mice were used for data acquisition. Three scales were constructed and included in testing procedures. X individually house mice were monitored continuously for an average of 5 days. In total, X individual hours in which a manual weight and recorded scale weight were evaluated.
