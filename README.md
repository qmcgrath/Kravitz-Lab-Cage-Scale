# Kravitz-Lab-Cage-Scale
The use of food and water restriction, drugs, surgery, and disease models in live mouse studies require continuous monitoring of body weight to surveill mouse health and determine experiment endpoints. Traditional manual weighing induces stress in mice and disrupts circadian rhythms. This small mouse scale fulfills the need for a low cost, open source automatic scale that can fit in a tradition colony rack mouse cage. 
It has almost hourly resolution and a typical accuracy of < %.

The device records . 

Accuracy was determined via comparision of maunaul weighing and reported weights for the same hour. X instances were used. 

Assemebly, quick start instructions, and code documentation are available in the wiki. 
Jupyter notebooks are provided. In these notebooks you will find code to plot . In addition, you will find the analysis code used to determine the varying accuracy . This code also demonstartes the various data filtering technqiues explored.
